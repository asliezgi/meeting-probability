This code was written to achieve a mathematical generalization of calculating the probability of two or more objects meeting within a certain time interval, provided that the one that arrives first waits for the other for a certain period of time.

It was initially inspired by this problem: Two persons are supposed to meet a spot at a time interval of one hour. The person who comes first will wait for a maximum of 15 minutes for the second person.
